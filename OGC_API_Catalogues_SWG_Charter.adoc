To:  OGC members & interested parties

A new OGC Standards Working Group (SWG) is being formed. The OGC members listed below have proposed the "OGC API - Catalogues SWG".  The SWG proposal provided in this document meets the requirements of the OGC Technical Committee (TC) Policies and Procedures.

The SWG name, statement of purpose, scope, list of deliverables, audience, and language specified in the proposal will constitute the SWG's official charter. Technical discussions may occur no sooner than the SWG's first meeting.

This SWG will operate under the OGC IPR Policy. The eligibility requirements for becoming a participant in the SWG at the first meeting (see details below) are that:

* You must be an employee of an OGC member organization or an individual
member of OGC;

* The OGC member must have signed the OGC Membership agreement;

* You must notify the SWG chair of your intent to participate to the first meeting. Members may do so by logging onto the OGC Portal and navigating to the Observer page and clicking on the link for the SWG they wish to join and;

* You must attend meetings of the SWG. The first meeting of this SWG is at the time and date fixed below. Attendance may be by teleconference.

Of course, participants also may join the SWG at any time. The OGC and the SWG welcomes all interested parties.

Non-OGC members who wish to participate may contact us about joining the OGC. In addition, the public may access some of the resources maintained for each SWG: the SWG public description, the SWG Charter, Change Requests, and public comments, which will be linked from the SWG’s page.

Please feel free to forward this announcement to any other appropriate lists. The OGC is an open standards organization; we encourage your feedback.

== Purpose of the Standards Working Group

The purpose of this Standards Working Group is to:

   * Develop a new version of the HTTP Protocol Binding for the OGC Catalogue Service standard
     as a Web API.
   * Develop new parts of the OGC API Catalogues multipart standard
   * Develop corrigenda for previous versions of the catalogue
     standard(s) 

== Business Value Proposition

In order to be able to exploit geospatial resources (e.g., feature collections,
coverages, etc.) and other related resources (code lists, definitions, etc.),
end-users must be able to discover and fetch those resources. The proposed _Catalogue_
Web API provides the methods and apparatus to support

* Discovery of geospatial resources by standardizing the way collections of descriptive information about the resources (metadata) are exposed;

* Discovery and sharing of related resources that may be referenced from geospatial resources or their metadata by standardizing the way all kinds of records are exposed and managed.

For providers of geospatial resources who need to catalogue their holdings,
the catalogue provides a uniform means for indexing those resources as
metadata records. The same uniform interface may be used for managing and
sharing the related resources.

```
The following paragraph needs a bit more work. You say "the standard". What standard?
Also, perhaps provide examples of what is meant by "bare minimum". Finally, the sentence that starts with "it". What does "it" refer to? Best not to start sentences with "it" :-)
```

For developers building infrastructures to host, harvest and/or manage
collections of geospatial resources, the standard defines the bare minimum
needed to describe those resources. It is customizable for particular
domains of interest. 

Finally, users of geospatial resources are often in a position of having to
construct specialized processing flows for each different collection of
geospatial resources that they consume. The Catalogue API will be defined to reduce
such complexity and encourage the use of common tooling.

== Scope of Work

The current versions of the catalogue standards (i.e. CAT 2.0, CAT 3.0) -- developed in the early 2000s -- use a Remote-Procedure-Call-over-HTTP architectural style using XML for any payloads.  This was considered state-of-the art at the time but this legacy is now badly outdated and does not conform to current web development practices.

The definition of an "OGC API - Catalogues" is intended to break free of this legacy and will specify a modernized service that aligns with the current architecture of the Web and the Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices (https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/). The key changes shall be as follows.

* Name: +
The formal proposed name of the new standard is "OGC API - Catalogues - Part 1: Core".  However, one of the first actions of the SWG shall be to settle on a name.  Other proposed names include "OGC API - Metadata" and "OGC API - Records".

* Scope: +
Catalogues have, in the geospatial domain, traditionally been used to access
collections of formal metadata such as FGDC, ISO19115 or ISO19119 metadata
documents.  While the intent of the CAT4.0 SWG is to preserve this functionality
going forward, there is also a desire to broaden the scope so that a catalogue
can also act as a registry of other types of descriptive metadata about
resources such as code lists.

* Architecture: +
"OGC API - Catalogues" shall support and be consistent with HTTP and HTTPS. In previous versions, HTTP has been used mainly as a tunnel for CAT messages. In addition, the resources provided by the service shall include hypermedia controls in their representations to guide the user of a catalogue.

```
Note for above. I would not use the word "shall" in this context. Sounds like procurement language and not definition of scope in an OGC SWG charter.  Better to reword such as "The definition of the "OGC API - Catalogues" will be consistent with HTTP and HTTPS." Further, would it not be better to define the API at an abstract level and then specify the HTTP instantiation of that model? Using an abstract approach would allow for implementation of the API in other platforms and infrastructures.
```

* Encodings: +
Previous versions were strongly tied to XML (Capabilities documents, XML schemas, Filter Encoding expressions, etc.). This version shall be written with JSON, HTML, and XML as primary encodings in mind, given these are common encodings today.  No encoding shall be mandatory and other encodings may be used as well. HTTP is designed to support the use of multiple formats and defines rules about how servers can return the encoding that the client can best handle (“content negotiation”).

```
Same comments are for Architecture. Need to make sure the scope wording focuses on the decisions that the SWG will make and not overly restrict discussions.
```

* Basic information model: +
Previous versions of the CAT 3.0 standard used the Dublin Core set of metadata (encoded as XML) as the basic, cross-platform, information model or set of queryables that all implementations needed to support.  "OGC API - Catalogues" will review the use of this model and strongly consider using DCAT (https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/) instead.

* Reuse: +
The use of CAT-specific resources or components will be minimized and, where available, existing industry-standards that are commonly used by developers shall be used instead. The most important example for this is the use of an OpenAPI definition instead of OGC-specific "Capabilities" documents.

* Modularization: +
The CAT 3.0 standard, together with the Filter Encoding 2.0 standard, specifies a powerful, but complex service interface. In order to better support implementations that only need a relatively simple service or client, the next version shall be modularized into multiple parts. The first part (the "core") shall specify a simple interface to access metadata from catalogues that is sufficient for cases that do not require support for transactions, complex data structures, rich queries, etc. Additional parts will specify extensions to this part to meet the needs of use cases that require such capabilities.

```
Same issue with the word "shall". I would reword "the next version shall be modularized into multiple parts. The first part (the "core") shall specify a simple interface to access metadata from catalogues that is sufficient . .  "

as

". . . the intent is to modularized the next version of the standard into multiple parts. The first part (the "core") will specify a simple interface to access metadata from catalogues that is sufficient . . ."
```

* Security: +
CAT 3.0, like many other OGC web standards, does not specify how services may be secured and some requirements are incompatible with secured services that still conform to the standard. The use of OpenAPI would address this issue, too. Catalogues Services may be secured using security schemes that are commonly used on the Web today (e.g., OAuth2) and that developers are familiar with.

As a result of the planned modernization of the current Catalogue Standard, "OGC API - Catalogues" implementations will not be backwards compatible with CAT 3.0 implementations per se. However, a design goal is to define "OGC API - Catalogues" in a way so that the interface can be mapped to a CAT 3.0 or CAT 2.0  implementations - at least for the capabilities that were already in scope for those standards.

"OGC API - Catalogues" is intended to be simpler and more modern, but still be an evolution from the previous versions and their implementations.

The goal is to develop part 1 of "OGC API - Catalogues", the foundation for the new version, as quickly as possible and work on additional parts after that, driven by community interest.

An important aspect is to ensure that implementing the standard will lead to efficient implementations, happy developers of both server and client components, and satisfied users of such components.

This has several aspects:

Before finalizing parts of the next version of "OGC API - Catalogues", it must be verified that these goals are met, i.e.:

  * Working implementations of all capabilities must be available and tested; and

  * Implementation feedback must be taken into account.

A consequence of this is that the period between the availability of what is considered a mature draft and the finalization of the official Member approved OGC Standard may be longer than in the past, depending on the availability of evidence about the suitability of the candidate standard based on implementations.

Developers, including those that are not active in OGC or ISO/TC 211, should be encouraged as early as possible to implement the draft Catalogue API standard and provide feedback. An aspect of this is public access to drafts from the beginning.

To this end, the SWG intends to use GitHub in the development of this standard as this is the environment may developer are familiar with and user on a daily basis.

== Statement of relationship of planned work to the current OGC standards baseline

This standard is intended to be a major revision to the Catalogue Services standards published by OGC. This revision will take advantage of Web API patterns identified in the OGC API standards efforts (e.g., OGC API - Features, AKA WFS 3.0) to better align with current and emerging IT practices. "OGC API - Catalogues" does overlap in scope with the existing OGC Catalogue Services standards.

== What is Out of Scope?

Standards are important for interoperability. At the same time, it is important
that standards only state requirements that are important for a significantly
large group of users.  Proposals for new parts of OGC API Catalogues or change
requests to existing parts must identify the user group that will benefit from
the proposal and include the commitment for three independent implementations
for each proposed conformance class; otherwise the proposal will be considered
out-of-scope. 

OGC API Catalogues is a modular, multi-part standard. Developing profiles of
OGC API Catalogues should not be necessary and is, therefore, out-of-scope
for the SWG. If a community has a need to develop a profile, the profile should
be specified and governed by that community.

== Specific Existing Work Used as Starting Point

The starting point for the work will be the "OGC® Catalogue Services 3.0 Specification - HTTP Protocol Binding", OGC 12-176r7.  The work shall also be informed by the following documents and by recommendations found in:

   * OGC/W3C Spatial Data Working Group on the Web Best Practices (https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/);

   * OGC Geospatial API White Paper (OGC 16-019r4);

   * OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core candidate standard, OGC 17-069r2; and

   * SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog API Specification (https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec).
   
```
Just be aware that STAC cannot be referenced as normative or used in normative language in an OGC standard. STAC can only be referenced as informative. This is an OGC policy directive WRT documents and specs developed by groups external to the OGC that are not recognized as formal SDOs.
```

Each of these documents recommends an emphasis on resource oriented APIs in future OGC standards development including use of tools such as OpenAPI.

In addition, the following metadata standards will be reviewed:

   * Data Catalogue Vocabulary (DCAT) (https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/);

   * Geographic information -- Metadata -- XML schema implementation (ISO/TS 19139:2007);

   * ebXML Registry Information Model, Version 3.0 (http://docs.oasis-open.org/regrep/regrep-rim/v3.0/regrep-rim-3.0-os.pdf).
   
```
FYI - The CDB SWG did a detailed review/analysis of 8 or so metadata standards and profiles of those standard. There is a SWG discussion paper as well as other information resources developed by the SWG. These documents may be useful in the planned work of this proposed SWG. These documents are on the CDB SWG portal project.
```

== Is This a Persistent SWG

YES

== When can the SWG be Inactivated

The SWG can be inactivated once the final multipart standard has been developed and change requests become minimal or not applicable for consideration. The SWG can be re-activated at any time.

== Description of deliverables

The following deliverables will result from the work of this SWG:

   * A final version of the "OGC API - Catalogue - Part 1: Core" document for
     submission to the TC; and

   * At least three prototype implementations of the core based on the standard -- although more would be preferred.

   * Zero or more additional parts as time and desire permits.

Part 1 will cover read-only access to records and simple query capabilities.

Capabilities for richer queries or to create, update or delete records will
be specified in additional parts.

== IPR Policy for this SWG

RAND-Royalty Free

== Anticipated Audience / Participants

Since we want implementations to proliferate the primary audience for the "OGC API - Catalogues" suite of standards shall be developers implementing servers. Additionally, target audiences of the standard shall include:

   * Deployers of catalogue services profiles; and

   * Dsers of catalogue services.

== Domain Working Group Endorsement

// The SWG will list all Domain Working Groups (DWGs) in which the SWG formation was discussed and/or chartered. If a DWG has specifically endorsed the formation of the SWG, then a statement of endorsement should be included.

== Other informative information about the work of this SWG

=== Collaboration

```
I would note that all votes on any issues or motions need to be SWG members only.  This includes making anything public. While the Git repo may be public and open, the actual day to day work of the SWG is not open. Obviously, input can be requested and the results of votes shared but only OGC SWG Members can vote.
```

The SWG intends to use the following GitHub repository for the development of the new standard: https://github.com/opengeospatial/CAT4.0.

Like the work done by the WFS/FES SWG, the GitHub repository will be open to
the public to solicit participation and feedback from OGC and non-OGC members.

Additional collaboration resources include periodic teleconferences, email
and/or a gitter channel.
